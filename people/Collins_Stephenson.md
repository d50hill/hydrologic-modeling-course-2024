Hello, my name is Collins Stephenson. I am a first-year master's student at USU, studying Civil Engineering with an emphasis in Hydrology and Water Resources. My research is centered on the effect of canal seepage on groundwater flow and temperature in a canal-shallow aquifer-river system! When I am not in the classroom or the office, I enjoy camping, motorcycle touring, reading, and music. I also enjoy picking up new hobbies, and I am always looking to learn something new.
