My name is Saddy Pineda, I am from Honduras and currently, I am doing a Ph.D. in Watershed Sciences, sponsored by the Fulbright Foreign Student Program. I am working with Dr. Sarah Null in the Aquatic Habitat, Climate, and Water Analysis (ACWA) Lab. My research interest is related to rainfall-runoff models, and climate predictions to better understand how climate variability might affect agriculture and ecosystems in Utah, including the potential of water banking to add flexibility for farmers and Great Salt Lake water managers.
